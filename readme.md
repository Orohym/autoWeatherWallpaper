### Only works on MacOS.


1. Run the code a first time, it should create the requested folders and print an message because no images are avalaible.
2. Add your images in each respective folders.
3. Run the script a second time.

# To Do
- Add a night mode: nigh images of the different weather
- Add description to auto-run the file when starting the computer
- (Maybe) add a execution at different times of the day (if the weather change)
- Improve the script by add a "Gaming" mode (could be nice :))
- Add script for windows
